So baby pull me closer
In the back seat of your rover
That I can afford
Bide the tatoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
So baby pull me closer
In the back seat of your rover
That I can afford
Bide the tatoo on your shoulder
