So baby pull me closer
In the back seat of your rover
That I can afford
Bide the tatoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson
Ok

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
